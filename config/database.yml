test:

# heroku autoconfigures production

#production:
#  adapter: mysql2
#  encoding: utf8
#  reconnect: false
#  database: vb-flagship_production
#  pool: 5
#  username: root
#  password:
#  host: 127.0.0.1
  ## JRuby doesn't support socket:
   #socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock


# heroku hopefully autoconfigures staging too (will find out soon enough)
